# Aligning OIB Snow Radar data

This is a method of co-locating traces from snow radar data in order to examine the evolution of snow/firn. The example shown is for Greenland, but this can also be used for Canadian and Alaska glaciers. Additionally, it can be used for Antarctica, but the cartopy projection must be changed to appropriate south polar stereographic projection.
