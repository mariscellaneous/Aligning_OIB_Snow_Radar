# Aligning OIB snow radar data

This is a method of co-locating NASA Operation IceBridge (OIB) snow radar traces from repeat flights to examine the evolution of snow/firn with time. The example shown is for Greenland, but this can also be used for Canadian and Alaska glaciers. Additionally, it can be used for Antarctica, but the cartopy projection must be changed to appropriate south polar stereographic projection. 

Below is example output, with the newer radar trace from 2012 on the top and the older, aligned radar data from two echograms in a repeat flight 2011:
